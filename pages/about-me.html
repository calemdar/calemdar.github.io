                <p>
                    My name is Cem Alemdar, pronounced "Gem", and I am a senior. I have a strong background in web development,
                    C++, shader programming and audio based programming. I am experienced with Unity, but not very experienced
                    with Unreal, but I am hoping to get a ton out of this class. I am interested in puzzle games, or multiplayer
                    games. I would really wish to make a multiplayer experience for this class, either splitscreen or online.
                    I have experience in UI/UX design, and have an interest in balanced game design. I feel I haven't made a game
                    that was challenging yet engaging enough for players to play over and over again. I prefer finding a unique
                    and intuitive game mechanic and building a game around it.
                </p>
