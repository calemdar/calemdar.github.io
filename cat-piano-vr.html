                    <p>
                        This name could be a bit misleading. There was no piano in this toy but the idea of it came from an improvisational
                        VR drum system, with moving objects in front of you that you can hit with your virtual drumsticks. This project took me
                        two and a half weeks to build by myself. I had Unity, and wanted to learn how to create a VR game using Unity.
                        I had to figure out many things; like attaching the drumsticks to the VR Touch controller, or how to build for an Oculus Quest.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        By this time I haven't yet tested the project because I had to learn how to build the Unity project into an Android app
                        with the specific SDK. After some struggle I built my Unity project on the Oculus Quest we had in the office where I was working
                        as a QA intern. Audio and collisions didn't work right the first time, but after trial
                        and error I fixed them. Next was to make this interaction with these cubes that are going from one side of the screen
                        to the other. I was also on a deadline because our company was holding a demo event with other developers in the area
                        of Baltimore. I wanted to user test this project and get feedback which was the most important drive of the project.
                        I wanted to create something, give it to someone to try it out, and see them interact with it. I know surveys and checklists
                        make user testing easier to process, but I believe so much important data can be lost in trying to define the experience
                        rather than just observing the player and seeing their experience as a unique experience. This can be done especially better
                        in VR because the players will know someone else is int the room watching them, while not feeling like someone is looking over
                        their shoulder. They are there for you to not knock something or bump into something since there are two giant screens in front
                        of your face.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I was not sure what audio sample to play for the interaction, and then I watched this video of a musician I follow, who talked
                        about a phenomena called "The Cat Piano". There is a link to the video below. To broadly describe what I understood about the video:
                        Hearing uncommon cat meows in a controlled environment is entertaining to everyone, when this is mixed with popular culture it creates an
                        urge to laugh for the listener upon confusion their engagement in the activity. So I tried to adapt this idea to the medium I was creating
                        my art in. I put few different cat pictures on the boxes and gave each of them a unique meow. I was able to do this thanks to freesound.org
                        and free browser based audio tools since I did not have a digital audio workstation on my laptop. It was demo day but interacting with these
                        cats did not feel satisfying enough. Even though I made myself laugh the first time I tested it. I learned how to integrate controller vibration
                        and haptic feedback. I mapped different cats to vibrate stronger or weaker depending on how loud or angry they sounded. Tested it again but
                        something was still missing. It was visual feedback. I was not giving the user any visual indication that they were interacting with this
                        virtual cat. Trying to change materials and visual effects seemed too much of a stretch considering people started showing up for the demo.
                        I simply made the cat increase its y-axis position which made it go up slightly. I built it tested it with my coworkers - They were testing it
                        for the first time - and got amazing reactions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Everybody that put on the headset had no idea why these boxes with cat pictures on them were going from the left to the right. But seeing that they
                        had these two long sticks attached to their hands, they tried to pet the cats with them. Their reaction was pure laughter every time. They didn't know
                        what this was, but they kept poking the cats, and the cats kept meowing and going up. Because of my lack of time, the collisions of the sticks and the cats
                        were not optimized, meaning you could wiggle one stick in the box which would trigger multiple collisions which made the cats louder and go high faster
                        Even though this could be considered a bug, it added so much to the player experience. Because the game did not have a goal, it was just an interactive
                        experience. But thanks to my last minute addition and this bug most players placed tried to get the cat as high as possible. Even though it would cause
                        many instances of the cat meowing audio that it sounded "angrier" people kept trying to focus on interacting with one cat rather than multiple at the
                        same time. Seeing my creative director laugh like a ten year old kid gave me great pleasure. Something I created positively affected all the people who
                        tested it. I also learned a lot about user testing in VR since different people with different experiences with VR consoles were playing with this VR toy.
                        Also the people watching the person playing it were curious of what was going on because the cat sounds would get very audible with the multiple collision
                        bug. I had around thirty different people test this out and I had a laugh rate of 100%. This simple phenomena proved its effectiveness in an environment
                        I created.
